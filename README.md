# Concurrent-User
This repository contains code that processes data in a csv file to calculate the peak Concurrent User (CCU) for each minute of a given day. The code reads data from a server URL, filters and cleans the data, calculates the duration and minute-wise buckets, and then calculates the CCU for each minute of the day
